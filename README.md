# whats_the_number

###Features:
- Number generation and comparison accomplished through use of Javascript & jQuery.
- Random image is generated and displayed using a REST API.

This app was one of my first solo projects involving Javascript, and one of my favorites. Fun to work on, and it shows how much I've learned, compared to when I began writing this app.

Originally titled "Guessing Game", the player could enter an unlimited amount of turns until the correct number was guessed and a 'You Win' message appeared on screen.

Months later, I was thinking for a way to make the app more entertaining. I added a number of guesses allowed (5), and used an API from a gif generator site (Giphy) to display a random image if/when the player has won.
